## Rent History 

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

data from \
<https://data.sa.gov.au/data/dataset/private-rent-report>

## Running Code

library set up

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(writexl)
library(ggplot2)

```

Set up data frame

```{r}

# Path to the rent library file
rent_history_path <- "C:/Project_R/Real_estate/real_estate/rent_history_ingested.xlsx"

# Load the directory of files 
df_rent_history <- read_excel(rent_history_path)

```

For further filter

```{r}

# Filter for postcode 5166
df_rent_filtered <- df_rent_history %>%
  filter(postcode == 5166)

# View the first few rows of the filtered data
head(df_rent_filtered)
```

Plot the filter data frame

```{r}

# Convert `quarter` to a date format for plotting
df_rent_filtered <- df_rent_filtered %>%
  mutate(quarter = as.Date(quarter))

# Create a plot for median rents over time for houses and flats
ggplot(df_rent_filtered) +
  # Line for 2BR flats
  geom_line(aes(x = quarter, y = `2BR_flats_median`, color = "2BR Flats"), na.rm = TRUE) +
  # Line for 3BR houses
  geom_line(aes(x = quarter, y = `3BR_houses_median`, color = "3BR Houses"), na.rm = TRUE) +
  # Line for total flats median
  geom_line(aes(x = quarter, y = total_flats_median, color = "Total Flats Median"), na.rm = TRUE) +
  # Line for total houses median
  geom_line(aes(x = quarter, y = total_houses_median, color = "Total Houses Median"), na.rm = TRUE) +
  labs(
    title = "Median Rent Trends Over Time for Postcode 5166",
    x = "Quarter",
    y = "Median Rent ($)",
    color = "Legend"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()


```

after that may be regression and get summary
