Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

data from\

## Running Code

library set up

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(writexl)
library(ggplot2)

```

Set up data frame

```{r}

# Path to the rent library file
rent_history_path <- "C:/Project_R/Real_estate/real_estate/rent_history_ingested.xlsx"

# Load the directory of files 
df_rent_history <- read_excel(rent_history_path)

```

For further filter

```{r}

interested_postcode <- 5043

```

```{r}

# Filter for postcode 5166
df_rent_filtered <- df_rent_history %>%
  filter(postcode == interested_postcode)

# View the first few rows of the filtered data
head(df_rent_filtered)
```

Plot the filter data frame

```{r}
# Convert `quarter` to a date format for plotting
df_rent_filtered <- df_rent_filtered %>%
  mutate(quarter = as.Date(quarter))

```

HOUSE

```{r}


# Create a plot for median rents over time for houses and flats
ggplot(df_rent_filtered) +
  # Points for 1BR flats
  geom_point(aes(x = quarter, y = `1BR_houses_median`, color = "1BR Flats"), na.rm = TRUE) +
  # Points for 2BR flats
  geom_point(aes(x = quarter, y = `2BR_houses_median`, color = "2BR Flats"), na.rm = TRUE) +
  # Points for 3BR houses
  geom_point(aes(x = quarter, y = `3BR_houses_median`, color = "3BR Houses"), na.rm = TRUE) +
  # Points for 4BR houses
  geom_point(aes(x = quarter, y = `4BR_houses_median`, color = "4BR Houses"), na.rm = TRUE) +
  # Points for total houses median
  geom_point(aes(x = quarter, y = total_houses_median, color = "Total Houses Median"), na.rm = TRUE) +
  labs(
    title = paste0("Median House Rent Trends Over Time for Postcode ", interested_postcode),
    x = "Quarter",
    y = "Median Rent ($)",
    color = "Legend"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()


```

```{r}

# Create a plot for median rents for flats (1BR, 2BR, 3BR, Total Flats)
ggplot(df_rent_filtered) +
  # Line for 1BR flats
  geom_point(aes(x = quarter, y = `1BR_flats_median`, color = "1BR Flats"), na.rm = TRUE) +
  # Line for 2BR flats
  geom_point(aes(x = quarter, y = `2BR_flats_median`, color = "2BR Flats"), na.rm = TRUE) +
  # Line for 3BR flats
  geom_point(aes(x = quarter, y = `3BR_flats_median`, color = "3BR Flats"), na.rm = TRUE) +
  # geom_point for total flats median
  geom_point(aes(x = quarter, y = total_flats_median, color = "Total Flats Median"), na.rm = TRUE) +
  labs(
    title = paste0("Median Flat Rent Trends Over Time for Postcode ",interested_postcode),
    x = "Quarter",
    y = "Median Rent ($)",
    color = "Legend"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

FLAT

```{r}

# Trend line

# Create a plot for median rents over time for houses and flats
ggplot(df_rent_filtered) +
  # Points for 1BR flats
  geom_point(aes(x = quarter, y = `1BR_houses_median`, color = "1BR Houses"), na.rm = TRUE) +
  # Trend line for 1BR flats
  geom_smooth(aes(x = quarter, y = `1BR_houses_median`, color = "1BR Houses"), method = "loess", se = FALSE, na.rm = TRUE) +
  
  # Points for 2BR flats
  geom_point(aes(x = quarter, y = `2BR_houses_median`, color = "2BR Houses"), na.rm = TRUE) +
  # Trend line for 2BR flats
  geom_smooth(aes(x = quarter, y = `2BR_houses_median`, color = "2BR Houses"), method = "loess", se = FALSE, na.rm = TRUE) +
  
  # Points for 3BR houses
  geom_point(aes(x = quarter, y = `3BR_houses_median`, color = "3BR Houses"), na.rm = TRUE) +
  # Trend line for 3BR houses
  geom_smooth(aes(x = quarter, y = `3BR_houses_median`, color = "3BR Houses"), method = "loess", se = FALSE, na.rm = TRUE) +
  
  # Points for 4BR houses
  # geom_point(aes(x = quarter, y = `4BR_houses_median`, color = "4BR Houses"), na.rm = TRUE) +
  # Trend line for 4BR houses
  # geom_smooth(aes(x = quarter, y = `4BR_houses_median`, color = "4BR Houses"), method = "lm", se = FALSE, na.rm = TRUE) +
  
  # Points for total houses median
  geom_point(aes(x = quarter, y = total_houses_median, color = "Total Houses Median"), na.rm = TRUE) +
  # Trend line for total houses median
  geom_smooth(aes(x = quarter, y = total_houses_median, color = "Total Houses Median"), method = "loess", se = FALSE, na.rm = TRUE) +
  
  labs(
    title = paste0("Median House Rent Trends Over Time for Postcode ", interested_postcode),
    x = "Quarter",
    y = "Median Rent ($)",
    color = "Legend"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()


```

after that may be regression and get summary

add map

```{r}

model_2BR <- lm(`2BR_houses_median` ~ quarter, data = df_rent_filtered)
summary(model_2BR)
plot(model_2BR)  # Diagnostic plots
influential <- cooks.distance(model_2BR) > (4 / nrow(df_rent_filtered))
df_rent_filtered_cleaned <- df_rent_filtered[!influential, ]

```

```{r}
ggplot(df_rent_filtered, aes(x = quarter, y = `2BR_houses_median`)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "blue") +
  labs(
    title = "Regression of 2BR House Median Rent Over Time",
    x = "Quarter",
    y = "Median Rent ($)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

```{r}

```

```{r}
model_mult <- lm(`2BR_houses_median` ~ quarter + `1BR_houses_median` + `3BR_houses_median`, data = df_rent_filtered)
summary(model_mult)

```

Forecast

```{r}
df_rent_filtered <- df_rent_filtered %>%
  mutate(quarter = as.Date(quarter))


```

```{r}
model_2BR <- lm(`2BR_houses_median` ~ quarter, data = df_rent_filtered)
summary(model_2BR)


```

```{r}
future_quarters <- data.frame(
  quarter = seq.Date(from = as.Date("2025-01-01"), to = as.Date("2025-12-31"), by = "quarter")
)


```

```{r}
future_quarters$forecasted_rent <- predict(model_2BR, newdata = future_quarters)


```

```{r}
df_combined <- df_rent_filtered %>%
  select(quarter, `2BR_houses_median`) %>%
  rename(rent = `2BR_houses_median`) %>%
  mutate(type = "Historical") %>%
  bind_rows(
    future_quarters %>%
      rename(rent = forecasted_rent) %>%
      mutate(type = "Forecast")
  )

```

```{r}
ggplot(df_combined, aes(x = quarter, y = rent, color = type)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(data = df_combined %>% filter(type == "Historical"), 
              method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "blue") +
  labs(
    title = "2BR House Median Rent Trends with Forecast for 2025",
    x = "Quarter",
    y = "Median Rent ($)",
    color = "Type"
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Historical" = "blue", "Forecast" = "red")) +
  theme_minimal()


```

```{r}
